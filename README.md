> Abstraction documentation for SJGL 1.0.0 and below

---

This release consists solely of abstraction for the classes and interfaces that are implemented in the 1.0.0 release of the sjgl-core. This is the only module with a currently planned abstraction branch and release (as of 9/21/2022). This is because the module it is planned for is the basis of what the other modules are built upon, and a good and planned abstraction for the classes/interfaces that others built off of allows for changes to be easily made and for flexibilty or the absense of it when creating a new class or module entirely.

This is only for the version 1.0.0 release of sjgl core, and does not contain any code, only a overtly specific and niche roadmap for the classes/interfaces. Any changes, removals, deprecations, fixes, and security notices would be mentioned in the Maven module.

This branch is broken into a similar way the the Maven module is structured. A Mermaid file is also included in the root git directory to show a graph in a tree and branch format to show the relationship of all the classes/interfaces.
