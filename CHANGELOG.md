## [Obfubscation]
This release consists solely of obfuscation for the classes and interfaces that are implemented in the 1.0.0 release of the sjgl-core. This is the only module with a currently planned obfubscation branch and release (as of 9/21/2022). This is because the module it is planned for is the basis of what the other modules are built upon, and a good and planned obfubscation for the classes/interfaces that others built off of allows for changes to be easily made and for flexibilty or the absense of it when creating a new class or module entirely.

This is only for the version 1.0.0 release of sjgl core, and does not contain any code, only a overtly specific and niche roadmap for the classes/interfaces. Any changes, removals, deprecations, fixes, and security notices would be mentioned in the Maven module.
